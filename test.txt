The Little Squirrel and the Big Oak Tree

Once, a little squirrel named Pippin wanted to reach the biggest acorn high up in the old oak tree. He tried climbing, but the branch was too wobbly.

"Let me help!" chirped his friend, Robin the bird, who flew up and gently nudged the acorn down.

But as it fell, the acorn rolled into a tiny creek! Just then, Shelly the turtle nudged it back onto the bank with her nose.

"Thank you, friends!" squeaked Pippin happily.

Together, they enjoyed the tasty acorn, grateful for teamwork and friendship.
